                Science Olympiad is an incredible program that inspires students to pursue STEM through 
                hands-on competition. But behind every successful team is a mountain of administrative 
                work—managing rosters, tracking attendance, creating practice tests, organizing events, 
                and so much more.

                <strong className="text-foreground">We believe that coaches, captains, and tournament directors 
                should spend their time mentoring students and building great teams—not wrestling with 
                spreadsheets and scattered tools.</strong> That&apos;s why we built Teamy: to give every 
                Science Olympiad team access to the same powerful management tools, regardless of their 
                school&apos;s resources.

                Teamy was created by a first-time Science Olympiad captain and tournament director 
                who experienced firsthand just how overwhelming it can be to manage a team while 
                also being a student.

              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Between juggling event assignments, coordinating practice schedules, creating study 
                materials, tracking attendance, managing budgets, and organizing an invitational 
                tournament—all while keeping up with schoolwork—it became clear that Science Olympiad 
                leaders needed better tools.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
                After searching for solutions and finding only scattered spreadsheets, outdated 
                websites, and expensive enterprise software, the decision was made: if the perfect 
                tool didn&apos;t exist, we&apos;d build it ourselves.

              <p className="text-lg font-medium text-foreground">
                Teamy is the platform we wish we had when we first took on leadership. Now, we&apos;re
