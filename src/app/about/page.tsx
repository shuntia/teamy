                Science Olympiad is an incredible program that inspires students to pursue STEM through 
                hands-on competition. But behind every successful team is a mountain of administrative 
                work—managing rosters, tracking attendance, creating practice tests, organizing events, 
                and so much more.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                <strong className="text-foreground">We believe that coaches, captains, and tournament directors 
                should spend their time mentoring students and building their teams, not wrestling with 
                spreadsheets and scattered tools.</strong> That&apos;s why we built Teamy: to give every 
                Science Olympiad team access to the same powerful management tools, regardless of their 
                school&apos;s resources.

                Some Science Olympiad teams have multiple dedicated coaches, abundant resources, and established

                passionate students trying to figure it all out on their own.

                state championships or a brand-new club meeting during lunch in a small classroom, you 
                deserve access to the same powerful management tools.

              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Teamy was created by a first-time Science Olympiad captains and tournament directors
                who experienced firsthand just how overwhelming it can be to manage a team while 
                also being a student.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Between juggling rosters, coordinating practice schedules, creating study materials,
                tracking attendance, managing budgets, and organizing logistics for invitational 
                tournaments, it became clear that Science Olympiad leaders needed better tools.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
                After searching for solutions and finding only scattered spreadsheets, outdated 
                websites, and expensive enterprise software, the decision was made: if the perfect 
                tool didn&apos;t exist, we&apos;d build it ourselves.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg font-medium text-foreground">
                Teamy is the platform we wish we had when we first took on Science Olympiad leadership.
                Now, we&apos;re sharing it with the entire community.
